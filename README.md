# weather-app

# prompt:

Build an interface that prompts a userâ€™s location and displays the current weather info about the location. Integrate whichever weather source you feel comfortable integrating and explain why you selected that source.

The app should require a user to sign in (does not need to be a full authentication process, just ask for a username to track the user), and the user should be able to setup multiple locations to check weather. When the app updates the weather info, it should update each location. The users and their locations should be stored in a database.

This task can be solved in whichever language you prefer. Please use whichever language you feel best showcases your skills.

Commit the code to GitHub, BitBucket, or other hosted Git repository and share it with our team to review.



# Planning and work estimates:

1. Have a working get request from the client to the db (5 hours) - actual ~10 hours
2. Build out other layers of the API (10 hours)                   - actual ~15 hours
3. Complete UX (5 hours)                                          - actual ~5  hours
4. Testing, refactoring and documentation (5 hours)               - actual ~5  hours
5. Refactoring into React App (10 hours)                          - actual ~10 hours

The backend architecture was heavily influenced by the following src:

1.    (Now removed! See old commits, if interested!)
2.    vanilla js,css,html -> see app/*  
3.    View/controller/model => app.js
4.    Services that talk to api => services.js

V2 
1. React App
2. React components in react-app/src/components/*
3. API services in react/app/src/services.js
4. /react-app/index renders react-app/App.js renders components

# Apis

https://www.zipcodeapi.com/API#zipToLoc 
      - Zipcode was used to get coordinate and city information
        based on zipcodes. It is free and easy to user

https://weather-gov.github.io/api/general-faqs
      - Weather.gov is data rich, free, and easy to use. No api
        key is needed, just a unique client tag
      - I've trusted weather.gov as my own weather source for a long time, so I trust its accuracy

# Possible Improvements
      - Authentication
      - Refacter all services and api logic with async/await
      - Get deployment working with a hosted database config
      

# Setup



MySQl (Updated)

- Now uses a dockerized mysql instance on an AWS EC2 instance, for local and production builds
